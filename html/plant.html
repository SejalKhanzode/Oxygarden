                <p>Epipremnum aureum is a trailing, leafy vine that can reach lengths of up to 40 feet in tropical
                    jungles. Its genus name is derived from the Greek words epi (meaning upon) and premnon (meaning a
                    trunk) in reference to its growing on tree trunks. Indoors, the pothos plant usually confines itself
                    to about six to 10 feet.The long stems trail or climb by aerial roots that adhere to surfaces,
                    making this a versatile choice for hanging baskets, plant stands, and bookshelves.</p>
                <p>Pothos is an evergreen plant with thick, waxy, green, heart-shaped leaves with splashes of yellow. As
                    a houseplant, it is commonly grown as a hanging plant. Pothos can climb by means of aerial roots,
                    and wild or cultivated plants grown outdoors can reach enormous heights using tall trees as
                    support.Best of all, pothos is one of the top houseplants for improving indoor air quality, making
                    home and office environments cleaner.</p>

                <p>Aloe vera has been used for medicinal purposes in several cultures for millennia: Greece, Egypt,
                    India, Mexico, Japan and China.1 Egyptian queens Nefertiti and Cleopatra used it as part of their
                    regular beauty regimes. Alexander the Great, and Christopher Columbus used it to treat soldiers’
                    wounds. The first reference to Aloe vera in English was a translation by John Goodyew in A.D. 1655
                    of Dioscorides’ Medical treatise De Materia Medica.2 By the early 1800s, Aloe vera was in use as a
                    laxative in the United States, but in the mid-1930s, a turning point occurred when it was
                    successfully used to treat chronic and severe radiation dermatitis.</p>
